LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models.

Key Features:
1. Chains: Connect multiple LLM calls and tools in sequence
2. Memory: Maintain conversation context across interactions
3. Agents: Enable LLMs to use tools and make decisions
4. RAG: Retrieve and use external knowledge for better answers

LCEL (LangChain Expression Language) provides a declarative way to compose chains.
It uses the pipe operator (|) to connect components in a readable manner.

Best Practices:
- Use appropriate chunk sizes for your documents (typically 500-1000 chars)
- Overlap chunks to maintain context (20% overlap is common)
- Choose the right embedding model for your use case
- Implement proper error handling in production
